## What is Integrated Development Workflow?

Integrated Development Workflow **flips the script** on ad-hoc AI coding. Instead of vibe-coding every piece from scratch, this skill provides a **complete, orchestrated workflow** that guides the agent through:

1. **Requirements** — Clear, documented goals
2. **Planning** — Task breakdown with dependencies
3. **Implementation** — TDD with proper branch management
4. **Testing & Review** — Verification before completion
5. **Completion** — Clean merge/PR workflow

---

## Get Started

Simply tell the agent what you want to build:

```
I want to build a user login feature
Implement a shopping cart
Create an API for user management
Fix the login timeout bug
Refactor the data layer
```

The skill will automatically:

1. Check for previous session
2. Create tracking files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
3. Guide through requirements
4. Plan the implementation
5. Execute with best practices

```bash
skill("integrated-dev-workflow")
```

## Agent Compatibility

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode | Cursor | Trae | Pi Agent | Windsurf |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Hooks | Full | Full | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Session recovery | Automatic | Automatic | Via script | Via script | Via script | Via script |
| File templates | All | All | All | All | All | All |
| TDD workflow | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| Code review workflow | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |

### Claude Code

This skill uses hooks for persistent reminders:

- **PreToolUse**: Reminds to update task_plan.md before major actions
- **PostToolUse**: Prompts to update task status after file changes
- **Stop**: Confirms task progress before ending session

### OpenCode

Full support via `.agents/skills` directory:

1. Copy this skill folder to `.agents/skills/`
2. Skills are automatically discovered
3. Use `skill("integrated-dev-workflow")` to invoke

### Cursor

Similar to Claude Code, hooks may work if Cursor supports extensions:

1. Try copying to `.cursor/skills/`
2. If hooks not supported, manual session recovery

### Trae

Trae is built on VS Code extension model:

1. Copy to `.trae/skills/` or VS Code extensions folder
2. May require manual workflow management

### Pi Agent Limitations

- Hooks are not supported in Pi Agent
- Session recovery requires manual script:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/session-recovery.py .
  ```

## File Structure

When installed, this skill creates tracking files:

```
your-project/
├── task_plan.md      # Phase tracking, task checklist
├── findings.md       # Research, decisions, notes  
└── progress.md       # Session log, test results, errors
```

### task_plan.md

```markdown
# Task Plan

## Goal
[BUILD X]

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Requirements
- [ ] Phase 2: Planning
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing & Review
- [ ] Phase 5: Completion

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
```

### findings.md

```markdown
# Findings

## Research
- [research notes]

## Technical Decisions
- [decisions made]

## Notes
- [additional notes]
```

### progress.md

```markdown
# Progress

## Session Log
- Started: 2024-01-01 10:00
- Created task_plan.md
- Defined requirements with user

## Test Results
| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| | |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| | |
```

## Zero-Dependency Hybrid Mode

This skill works in **two modes**:

### Mode 1: Advanced (with sub-skills)

If sub-skills are installed, this skill delegates to them for optimal experience:

- Try `skill("brainstorming")` first
- If skill not found, use inline fallback guide

### Mode 2: Standalone (zero-dependency)

If sub-skills are NOT installed, this skill uses **built-in fallback** content:

- All core workflows are documented inline
- Templates are embedded in this skill
- You follow the same process, but with guidance in this file

### How It Works

1. **First**: Try to invoke sub-skill `skill("xxx")`
2. **If not found**: Use the inline fallback guide for that step
3. **Result**: Works identically either way - just different experience levels

**Recommended**: Install sub-skills for best experience, but skill works completely without them!

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Design

- Define requirements with user
- Create specification (via spec-kit)
- Review and approve spec

### Phase 2: Technical Planning

- Plan technical approach
- Break into tasks
- Identify dependencies

### Phase 3: Implementation

- Create feature branch
- TDD for each task
- Update progress continuously

### Phase 4: Testing & Review

- Run all tests
- Verify build passes
- Code review

### Phase 5: Completion

- Final verification
- Create PR / merge
- Update final status

---

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature

User: "Add user authentication"

- Creates task_plan.md
- Asks: "What should auth include?"
- Documents requirements
- Plans: login, register, password reset, token handling
- Implements each with TDD
- Verifies and creates PR

### Example 2: Bug Fix

User: "Fix the login timeout"

- Creates task_plan.md
- Asks: "When does it timeout?"
- Researches in findings.md
- Plans: fix timeout, add retry
- Implements and verifies

### Example 3: Refactoring

User: "Refactor data layer"

- Creates task_plan.md
- Documents current problems
- Plans: extract interface, create repo, migrate
- Executes with test coverage
- Full regression testing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Session recovery fails

**Solution:** Read existing files, ask user to resume or start fresh

### User doesn't want to define requirements

**Solution:** Create minimal task_plan.md, note assumptions in findings.md

### Too many tasks

**Solution:** Break into phases, use subtask files

### Workflow interrupted

**Solution:** Update task_plan.md with exact next step before stopping
